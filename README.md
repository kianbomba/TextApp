# TextApp
Hello world, I just make a java console application that would save all your story or input into a text file under directory /text, once you save your story, you can make view it with loading it to the console, or open the text file. If there are bugs that you find out, please email to me kianbomba@gmail.com and I will try to fix it asap.
Thanks guys
